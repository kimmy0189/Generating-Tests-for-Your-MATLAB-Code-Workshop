## About the workshop
A brief introduction to some of the latest features aimed at software testing and automation is included in the [workshop slides](<Slides - What's new in managing, testing, and building your MATLAB code.pdf>).

The hands-on portion of the workshop will walk you through the steps listed in the [WorkshopGuide.pdf](WorkshopGuide.pdf) (or [WorkshopGuide.m](WorkshopGuide.m)), and will focus on the following features:
* Getting an overview of the quality of your project with the **`Code Quality Dashboard`**
* Generating tests for your code using:
  * your command history
  * starter tests
  * MATLAB Copilot
  * equivalence testing for generated C/C++ code
* Identifying which parts of your codebase are not being tested using the **`Code Coverate Report`**
* Standardizing your build and test process using the **`MATLAB build tool`**
* Automating your build and test process in CI using **`GitHub Actions`**

After completing the workshop, you should feel confident using some of MATLAB's latest features and integrating your code with CI systems!
